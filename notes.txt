•	In order to receive from other clients receive() must be nonblocking 
•	This makes send nonblocking
•	So must catch errors as it’s async
•	Server can remain blocking as it has nothing else to do; in separate threads already
•	Receive() should be in it’s own listening thread, and can then be blocking – easier to program and better memory use
